/*
 * This script is intended to be a level of indirection between the user who is installing LoreCommander
 * and the composer so that we can specify which composer.json configuration to use upon installation.
 *
 * The reason we have two composer.json files is because we want to make it easy for users, testers and
 * developers of Zermelo-DURC to be able to either:
 * 1- Use the most recent official releases from Packagist
 * OR
 * 2- Use the most recent code from GitHub. So we have two composer.json files:
 *
 * 1- composer.json - Requires the latest stable dist packages from Packagist
 * 2- composer-dev.json - Requires the latest source code from github, and includes repository references
 *
